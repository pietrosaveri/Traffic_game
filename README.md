# Traffic Dodging Game
---
# Overview

This project is a **car dodging game** built using **Python** and the **Pygame library**. The goal of the game is simple: control your car and dodge the incoming traffic for as long as possible. As the levels progress, the game becomes increasingly difficult, with cars coming faster and in larger numbers, eventually making it almost impossible to continueâ€”this adds to the challenge and fun!

The game begins with 1000 lives, allowing players to enjoy the gameplay longer before hitting the challenge wall.

To start the game, simply run the ```TrafficGame.py``` file.
